      description: "There is something indescribably beautiful about a classic toile pattern based on small hand-drawn strokes painting up romantic scenes usually consisting of lovebirds talking in the shade. We wanted to create a modern toile but maintain the traditional craftsmanship. This inviting, and a little mysterious, forest wallpaper is based on several toile designs where we only picked the trees from the romantic sceneries. If you want to fill the woods with a love message of your own, you can always use our design studio to carve your beloved's name in one of the tree trunks.",
